Iterate and Refine:

Iterate on analysis and visualization based on feedback from stakeholders or further insights gained from exploration. Refined visualizations to make them more informative, engaging, and actionable.


Results

The results from this project was generated by answering the following questions.

1. Considering the influence of factors like location and property features, how significant is the correlation between the number of bedrooms and the total price of properties in the dataset?

By using a Box and Whisper plot

Box Plot:

The box represents the interquartile range (IQR) of the data, with the median sum of prices depicted by a line inside the box for each category of bedrooms.
It provides insights into the central tendency of total prices across different bedroom categories.
The length of the box signifies the spread of total prices within each category of bedrooms.
The whiskers extend from the box, indicating the range of total prices excluding outliers.
Whisper Plot:

The whisper plot overlays individual data points, each representing a real estate property and its corresponding sum of prices and number of bedrooms.
It offers a detailed view of the distribution of total prices for each category of bedrooms.
Patterns or clusters of data points within the plot can indicate trends or correlations between total price and number of bedrooms.

Interpretation:

While the number of bedrooms affect the pricing of the various housing, it's just one of many variables that collectively determine property prices some of which are.


Location: The old adage "location, location, location" holds true in real estate. Properties in desirable neighborhoods or areas with good amenities, schools, transportation links, and low crime rates often command higher prices regardless of the number of bedrooms.

Property Size and Features: The total square footage of a property, as well as specific features like the presence of a backyard, swimming pool, or high-end appliances, can significantly influence its price.

Market Conditions: Supply and demand dynamics, as well as broader economic conditions, can impact real estate prices. In a seller's market with high demand and limited inventory, prices tend to rise, whereas in a buyer's market, prices may stagnate or even decrease.

Property Condition: The overall condition of the property, including any necessary repairs or renovations, can affect its perceived value and, consequently, its price.

Historical Trends: Historical sales data and price trends in the area can provide valuable insights into how prices have evolved over time and help forecast future price movements.

Given these factors conducting a thorough analysis that takes into account various factors can provide a more comprehensive understanding of real estate market dynamics.

2. What insights can be drawn from the bar chart in Tableau, where the x-axis represents different places and the y-axis represents prices? How do the prices vary across these places, and are there any noticeable trends or patterns that emerge? Additionally, what factors might be contributing to any disparities in prices observed among the different locations


The bar chart in Tableau, with the x-axis representing different places and the y-axis representing prices, provides valuable insights into the pricing dynamics across various locations. By analyzing the chart, we can observe how prices vary among different places and identify any discernible trends or patterns.

Upon examination, it becomes evident that there are variations in prices across the depicted places. Some locations may exhibit consistently higher prices, while others may have lower prices. These disparities could be influenced by several factors such as local economic conditions, demand-supply dynamics, cost of living, competition level, or even cultural preferences.

Furthermore, the chart may reveal certain trends or patterns. For instance, there might be clusters of places with similar price ranges, indicating regional pricing trends or market segmentation. Additionally, outliers in the data could signify unique market conditions or specific factors affecting prices in certain locations.

To gain a comprehensive understanding, it's crucial to delve deeper into the underlying factors contributing to the observed price disparities. This might involve conducting further analysis or exploring additional data sources to identify key drivers such as demographic profiles, industry trends, regulatory environments, or seasonal variations.

Overall, the bar chart serves as a valuable tool for understanding the pricing landscape across different places and provides insights that can inform strategic decision-making, market positioning, and pricing strategies.

3. How does the linear regression analysis of real estate data, particularly regarding the relationship between square footage and price,   
   provide insights into property valuation and potential price predictions?

The linear regression analysis of real estate data, focusing on the relationship between square footage and price, offers valuable insights into property valuation and potential price predictions. By fitting a regression model to the data, we can determine the average change in price associated with each additional square foot of living space. This understanding helps in assessing the impact of property size on its market value, allowing for more informed decision-making in buying, selling, or investing in real estate. Moreover, the regression model enables us to make predictions about property prices based on their square footage, aiding in pricing strategies and negotiations. Overall, leveraging linear regression analysis in real estate provides a quantitative framework for understanding property valuation dynamics and making data-driven predictions in the market.

Challenges
Some of the challenges faced included having to deals with missing data, which would affect the accuracy of the data provided, and would require extensive cleaning and preprocessing before visualization can occur. Some of the missing data included zip codes and host names. Therefore the data shown included only the available data.

Determing profit was difficult as no data showing cost was provided so therefore comparison could not be made as to the profitability of a unit available for rent.

Deciding on which visualtion was the most suitable to present the information in a very easy to understand manner, that will best convey the information to the user.

Future Goals
Clean up the data more and ensure that it more accurate to present to the required audience.

Use other wasys to combine the data presented to give more insights into the provided data.
